## 209.Minimum Length Subarray
> 题目链接:(https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/)

### Question Description
Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, return the **minimal length** of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, return `0` instead.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]
Output: 1
```
#### Constraints:
- 1 <= target <= 109
- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 104

### First Time Thoughts
这道题我首先想到的是用双层循环，第一层循环通过target-nums[i]来找到对应的值，然后再去第二层循环里一个个匹配，最后得到最短长度，但是这段代码存在一些逻辑问题。<br>
  1. 首先，在内部的两个嵌套循环中，第一个循环是在整个数组中寻找匹配的值，而不是在当前位置之后的元素中寻找，这样可能会导致错误的匹配。<br>
  2. 此外，这段代码只尝试了一次匹配，找到一个符合条件的子数组后就立即返回其长度。但实际上，可能有多个子数组的长度满足条件，我们需要找到最短的一个。<br>

The first thing I thought of for this question was to use a double-layer loop. The first-layer loop uses target-nums[i] to find the corresponding value, and then goes to the second-layer loop to match one by one, and finally gets the shortest length. But this paragraph There are some logic issues with the code. <br>
  1. First, in the two inner nested loops, the first loop looks for matching values in the entire array instead of looking for elements after the current position, which may lead to incorrect matches.<br>
  2. Additionally, this code only attempts a match once, and returns the length of a matching subarray as soon as it is found. But in fact, there may be multiple subarrays whose lengths meet the conditions, and we need to find the shortest one. <br>

### Error Codes
```
 var minSubArrayLen = function(target, nums) {
    let end=0;
    let start =0;
    var length=0;
    for(let i=0;i<nums.length;i++)
    {
        var numbers= target - nums[i];
        if(numbers > 0)
        {
            for(let j=0;j<nums.length;j++)
            {
                if(numbers == nums[j])
                {
                    end = j;
                    start = i;
                    length = end -start+1;
                    return length;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return 0;
```
### Reasons for Error
1. The relationship between the two loops is illogical. There is no way to find the shortest array. It only matches once and breaks out of the loop<br>

     Two pointers, right and left, are set up. Right is a fast pointer and left is a slow pointer. Right is responsible for superimposing sum through sum += nums[right] in the first loop until sum is greater than or equal to target, and then continues the while loop. Here, move the left pointer to the right, gradually reducing the length of the minimum array until the while loop is jumped out.

### Correct Code
```
 var minSubArrayLen = function(target, nums) {
    let minLength = Infinity;
    let sum = 0;
    let left = 0;

    for (let right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
        sum += nums[right];

        while (sum >= target) {
            minLength = Math.min(minLength, right - left + 1);
            sum -= nums[left];
            left++;
        }
    }

    return minLength !== Infinity ? minLength : 0;
};
```
### Conclusion
1. The change in the size of the sliding window is due to the superposition of sum += nums[right], or the reduction of sum -= nums[left]
